# Fake News Detection
Fake news detection is a critical area of research aimed at identifying misleading, false, or deceptive information presented as factual news. With the rapid growth of online platforms and social media, the spread of fake news has become a significant issue, influencing public opinion and decision-making.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify news statements as true or fake. The model is trained using the LIAR dataset, which contains labeled political news statements along with metadata.

By preprocessing text data, simplifying labels, and employing a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, this project achieves significant results in distinguishing real news from fake news.
