# Fake News Detection
Fake news detection is a crucial field focused on identifying misleading, false, or deceptive information disguised as factual news. The rapid proliferation of online platforms and social media has amplified the spread of fake news, making it essential to develop robust tools for combating misinformation.

This project aims to tackle fake news detection through multiple approaches, implemented in several phases. Each phase will explore different methodologies, from traditional machine learning algorithms to advanced deep learning models.

Phase 1: CNN-Based Approach
In the first phase, we implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for fake news detection. This phase involves:

Preprocessing text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., tokenization and stopword removal).
Training the CNN on the LIAR dataset, a benchmark dataset containing labeled political news statements.
Evaluating the model's performance to establish a baseline for comparison in future phases.
